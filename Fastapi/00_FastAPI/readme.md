## API working

API is in simple analogy it work like as a waiter in a restaurant.

- Customers can place orders
- Waiter can serve the order
- Customers can check the order status

we can build a project without api too using monolithic approach where we have a single file where all the logic is written.

- but this is not scalable

## API follow the protocol that is HTTP and REST

for return data we use JSON

# For ML perspective

- Ml model -> Backend for ml : where it accept the data and return the prediction

# for public to use model

we app API -> backend -> ml model
